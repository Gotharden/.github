"One can quickly create when they can quickly learn"

- **Coding Languages**: C++, C, and Python
- **Projects**: I love building Softwares that simulate things in the real world, track news all around the world and make things easier for people, though i don't like making them public at most
- **Life**: Learn new things, even if not related to tech. Do Calisthenics and more...
**Languages I'm learning:**
None for now.
**Tools I use:**
- Git & GitHub
